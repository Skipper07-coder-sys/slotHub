# Changelog

## slotHub

Changes in this fork, on top of slot 1.6.0.

- Pure mode. `pure = on` in `Config/pure.txt` switches off fast-forward, rewind, the turbo buttons, save states and the save state switcher, and a resume can be used once. Shaders, palettes and the other screen settings stay. There is no setting for it on the device. See the README.
- The shelf shows where you are while it moves: a row of five first letters over the carts, the current one in the middle, gliding on the same spring as the carts, and the selected game's name pressed into the slot. Names too long for the slot scroll. They stay up while you scroll, even holding a direction, and fade away about 3 seconds after the shelf stops, or once a long name has scrolled all the way round, and the name sinks into the slot with the cart. This replaces the faint letter that showed in the slot after an Up / Down jump. The letters use Inter SemiBold (SIL OFL 1.1, `licenses/inter-OFL-1.1.txt`).
- Five more screen shaders: LCD1x, Retro, Bevel, CRT and Curved CRT, plus LCD3x 18/12 (a brighter LCD3x with fainter stripes), ported from the libretro shader collection. Both the GBA and the GB / GBC shader settings now offer every shader. Simpletex is gone (and LCD Grid, which stuttered on the H700), and Game Boy and Game Boy Color now start on Grid; a saved Simpletex or LCD Grid setting reads as the platform's default.
- The Self-Test and Bug Report rows are gone from the Update page. The self-test after an update still runs quietly and crash reports are still saved, for remote debugging.
- Settings: Network and Choose Network are one row. It shows the network you are on, and A opens the list, where saved networks join without their password (Y types a new one). The Wi-Fi page keeps Wi-Fi, Network and Wi-Fi Drive. RetroAchievements moved to Gameplay and Game Artwork to Update. Text too long for its place scrolls right to left on the highlighted row (Settings, the Wi-Fi list and the headphones list), and other rows end it with "...".
- Link play over home Wi-Fi. When both handhelds are on the same home network, the link cable meets over it instead of bringing up its own private network, and home Wi-Fi stays connected. The host announces the game over mDNS, the joiner looks for a host running the same game, and a host only accepts a handheld that greets it with that game's code. With home Wi-Fi off or not connected, the direct link works as before. The link screen's role picker shows a HOME WI-FI or DIRECT LINK plate saying which one a link would use. Ported from Prashant Vaibhav's fork [pvaibhav/slot](https://github.com/pvaibhav/slot) (GPL-3.0), adapted to slotHub's own Wi-Fi script: `slotlink.sh link lan` reports the home address from `wifi.sh`.

## [1.6.0](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.6.0)

- Runs on the RG28XX: its panel is mounted portrait, so slot turns the picture onto it. (#35)
- Pokémon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire rumble. mGBA now sees the game's Game Boy Player check. You still need to turn rumble on in game settings. (#25)
- A red alarm shows when the SD card turns read-only or a save fails to write.
- A new shortcut for mute: SELECT + VOL+ / VOL-. The 34XX has a fake volume wheel so VOL+ + VOL- isn't possible. (#39)
- Game Boy cartridge clocks are kept in the .sav. (#22)
- The GBA cartridge clock keeps running on gpSP while the game is off.
- Large libraries now should boot faster, and the first frame shows sooner.
- Games start faster: resting on a cart reads its ROM ahead, so big ROMs no longer wait on the SD card when you insert them.
- Wallpapers are dealt from a shuffled deck, so none repeats until all have shown.
- PNG art is turned the way its EXIF orientation tag says.
- When slot crashes it logs where, and keeps that run's log in `crash/` to attach to a bug report.
- The BaseOS startup sound no longer leaves slot silent. (#20)
- A user defined `Config/bootlogo.bmp` will take precedence over the shipped one. (#30)
- Cart shell, core and video mode files are now `.txt` instead of `.ini`, so Chrome on Windows opens them. slot renames them on first boot. (#15)
- The grid shader's lines stay even on the RG34XX and at fractional scales, and the dot shader no longer darkens a white screen as much. (#26, #36)

## [1.5.0](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.5.0)

- Rumble regression fixed.
- The boot logo is built to the size of the one BaseOS installed, so it fits every panel instead of only 720x480.
- Runs on the RG35XXSP: the picture fills the 4:3 screen's width and a GBA SP bezel sits underneath while a game plays.
- Screen shaders chosen per platform: Off, LCD3x, Grid or Dot for GBA, and Off, Grid or Simpletex for Game Boy and Game Boy Color.
- SELECT + B / A in game steps back and forth through the screen shaders. A game's own soft reset that holds SELECT with A or B no longer reaches it; hold A on the carousel to start a game fresh instead.
- New settings: auto save on eject, turbo buttons and rewind can each be switched off.
- Settings are grouped into Screen and Gameplay pages, and every value wraps from the last choice to the first.
- Label art is cached on the card, so the shelf no longer stutters building cart faces. New labels are cached once at boot behind a Caching New Labels screen.
- Named palettes for Game Boy games: turn on GB Palettes in the Screen settings, then SELECT + L2 / R2 in game steps back and forth through mGBA's 48 palettes.
- The speaker no longer buzzes while nothing is playing. slot lets go of the audio device after 3 seconds of silence and takes it back when sound starts. Thanks to flo333 for finding it.

## [1.4.0](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.4.0)

- The volume bar shows a headphones icon while they are plugged in.
- Speaker and headphones keep their own volume and mute, and switch the moment you plug / unplug.
- Settings moved from `System/` to a new `Config/` folder, so replacing `System/` on update no longer resets them. slot moves them on first boot.
- The quick menu and power menu wrap from the last item to the first, and back.

## [1.3.0](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.3.0)

- The SP boots to a slot logo instead of BaseOS's. slot installs `System/bootlogo.bmp` on first run and keeps the original as `bootlogo.baseos.bmp`.

## [1.2.2](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.2.2)

- Fix for hitch in games caused by autosave. The autosave now writes to the card in the background.

## [1.2.1](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

- Shell colors from Cart Studio now apply to games with accented names.
- Clear GBA carts no longer show their circuit board above the label.

## [1.2.0](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

- Hold X for turbo A and Y for turbo B.
- Carts on the shelf are larger, and shrink into the slot as they go in.
- Carts are drawn at their real proportions, so full label scans fit without cropping.
- Jumping a letter with Up or Down shows the letter in the slot.
- Saves now stick for games whose save is smaller than the core first reports, such as Golden Sun on mGBA.
- The seated cart no longer shows through the slot as a game starts.
- SELECT reaches the game as soon as it can no longer be the start of a shortcut.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.1.0)

- Fast-forward runs several game frames per refresh, so it is properly fast, and rewind no longer records while fast forwarding.
- The About label credits BaseOS.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

- Game Boy and Game Boy Color, each on its own shelf. L1 and R1 switch shelves, and carts are drawn at their own size in their own plastics.
- Two cores, mGBA and gpSP. Press START on a cart to open it and swap the chip.
- Link play between two RG SPs over WiFi: the link cable and the Wireless Adapter for Pokémon trades and Advance Wars, mGBA's link mode for Mario Kart, and Game Boy link for Tetris.
- A quick menu on the shelf for fast forward speed and sound, rumble, color correction, the date and time, and About.
- Game Boy games stretch to fill the screen with L1 and go back with R1.
- The real BIOS boot animation plays when the card has one.
- Per-cart shell colors, set in `cart_shell.ini`.
- Up and Down jump through the shelf a letter at a time.
- Your own folder layout on the card is kept, and slot runs on upstream BaseOS.

## [0.1.1](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v0.1.1)

- The game holds still behind the power menu.
- Rewind records at every speed and replays exactly what happened.

## [0.1.0](https://github.com/BrandonKowalski/slot/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

- First release: a GBA-only shelf of cartridges with an insert scrape and clunk.
- The game in the slot resumes on the next boot. Closing the lid sleeps and saves.
- Save states with a switcher, rewind, fast-forward, brightness, blue light and volume.
- A power menu on a held POWER, and an About label.
